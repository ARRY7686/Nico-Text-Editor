# Nico Text Editor
A rich-text editing interface for Niance Editor built on top of HTML5 2D canvas from scratch.
Right now, we aim to build just a proper text-editing interface which supports the following features:-
- Keyboard Navigation and Selection
- Mouse Navigation and Selection
- Cut, Copy, Paste actions
- Undo, Redo actions
- Text Highlighting

Right now, we plan to use a gap-buffer data structure for storing text.<br>
As the project progresses, we might move toward a Rope data structure

# Features implemented till date
- Text editing
- Efficient text storage using gap buffers
- Multi-line support

# Yet to implement
- Cut, Copy, Paste actions
- Undo, redo actions
- All kinds of selection actions like backspace on a selection, moving a selection to another part of the document
- Optimizations in canvases, efficient clearing, efficient updating etc.
